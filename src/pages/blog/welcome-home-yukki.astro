          <p>
            I don't know where to start.. :)
          </p>

          <p>
            My girlfriend always wanted a Shiba Inu. Not just "wanted" in a casual way. This was her lifelong dream. The kind of dream that doesn't fade with time.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've been dating for about a year now, but this dream? It started way before me.
          </p>

          <p>
            And I didn't get it at first. I mean, they're cute dogs. But what made them so special?
          </p>

          <p>
            So I did what any supportive partner would do. I started researching :)
          </p>

          <h2>Falling Down the Shiba Inu Rabbit Hole</h2>

          <p>
            The more I learned, the more I understood. Shiba Inus aren't just dogs. They're personalities wrapped in fur.
          </p>

          <p>
            They're independent and don't need constant attention like other breeds. They're smart and sometimes too smart for their own good. They're stubborn and will test your patience regularly :)) And they're loyal. Once they bond with you, that bond is unbreakable.
          </p>

          <p>
            People often describe them as "cat-like," and that comparison clicked for me. It's like they have a cat trapped in their soul. They groom themselves constantly and are incredibly clean animals. They don't have that typical "dog smell" that some breeds have. They hate getting dirty.
          </p>

          <p>
            And just like cats, they're affectionate on their own terms. They'll come to you when they want attention, not necessarily when you want to give it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had a cat when I was around ten years old, a Turkish Angora named Oliver. He lived with me for about 2-3 years. He was independent but affectionate on his own terms, but I'd never had a dog before. Never. The thought made me nervous. Dogs are a big responsibility. They need training, attention, and time. But a Shiba Inu? That felt different. It felt like the perfect bridge between my past with cats and our future as dog owners :)
          </p>

          <h2>Finding the Perfect Breeder</h2>

          <p>
            My girlfriend started searching for breeders. This part is crucial. You can't just buy a Shiba Inu from anywhere. Responsible breeding matters. Health matters. Temperament matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            My girlfriend did all of the research. She's thorough like that. And she found a place called Kolgerhouse Kennel.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's a professional Shiba Inu breeder located in Gomel, Belarus. The website looked professional. The reviews were glowing. The dogs looked healthy and happy :))
          </p>

          <p>
            Karina reached out to Tatiana, who's responsible for all these energetic Shiba Inu puppies at the kennel. Tatiana responded quickly. She was warm, professional, and clearly passionate about her dogs :)
          </p>

          <p>
            She answered every single question we had. And we had a lot of questions :)))) Thanks for your patience again, Tatiana :)
          </p>

          <p>
            What's the puppy's diet? What vaccinations do they get? What's their temperament like? Can we visit before committing? Tatiana answered everything with patience and detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            We knew immediately we'd found the right place.
          </p>

          <h2>The Waiting Game Begins</h2>

          <p>
            Then Tatiana told us something we weren't expecting. The mother dog was pregnant. We were over the moon, but we'd have to wait. And not just wait for the birth, there was more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even after the puppies were born, we couldn't see them right away. There's a mandatory 12-week waiting period. Newborn puppies are incredibly vulnerable to viruses and infections.
          </p>

          <p>
            But man, waiting was hard. We were so excited. We wanted to see them immediately :). But patience is part of responsible dog ownership. So we waited.
          </p>

          <p>
            About a month after the puppies were born, Tatiana called. "Would you like to come visit?" she asked. We couldn't believe it. She was bending the rules slightly to let us meet the puppies a bit early. We jumped at the chance. When we arrived, Tatiana greeted us warmly. She led us to where the puppies were playing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I wasn't prepared for what I saw. Four tiny Shiba Inu puppies. All fluffy. All adorable. All perfect.
          </p>

          <!-- Image 1: After "All perfect." -->

          </figure>

          <p>
            They tumbled over each other. They played with toys. They made tiny squeaking sounds. My heart melted instantly. Tatiana introduced us to each one and put 2 of them in my lap and put 2 of them in Karina's lap :)
          </p>

          </figure>

          <p>
            They all looked similar. Same fluffy coats. Same tiny paws. Same curious eyes. How do you choose between four perfect puppies?
          </p>

          <p>
            Three of them were super playful, bouncing around, chasing each other, causing chaos. But one puppy was different. He just sat there, calm and chill, watching everything. He wasn't avoiding the others. He was just... observing. He had this serious expression on his face, like he was studying everything around him. His face was darker than the others too. That's the one my girlfriend picked :) She already made up her mind. For me, I had no idea which one to pick! Here is Yukki!
          </p>

            <figcaption>Yukki - the calm observer with the serious expression</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            We left Kolgerhouse that day without bringing a puppy home. The puppies still needed more time with their mother for their development.
          </p>

          <h2>Preparing for Yukki</h2>

          <p>
            During the waiting period, we prepared everything. We researched names for him. Finding one didn't take too long. I was reading Shiba Inu names out loud, and the moment I said "Yukki," it clicked right away for both of us. That's the one, Yukki!
          </p>

          <p>
            We bought food bowls and toys. We puppy-proofed our apartment. We researched training techniques. We watched way too many YouTube videos about Shiba Inu care :)
          </p>

          <p>
            We were ready.
          </p>

          <!-- Image 6: After "We were ready." -->

            <figcaption>All prepared and ready for Yukki's arrival!</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>The Big Day</h2>

          <p>
            Two weeks later, Tatiana called us! It's time to bring Yukki home!
          </p>

          <p>
            When we arrived, Yukki was bigger than we remembered. Two weeks make a big difference in puppy development. But he still had that same serious expression :) That same calm demeanor. Tatiana let us spend time with him. She gave us Yukki's paperwork, tips, what to expect in the first few weeks, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            We carefully wrapped Yukki in his blanket. He was very quiet and fell asleep almost immediately.
          </p>

          <!-- Image 4: After "almost immediately." -->

            <figcaption>Yukki sleeping peacefully on his first car ride home</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            I think this was his first car ride away from everything he knew. The rest of the drive was quiet. We were both processing reality. We were dog owners now.
          </p>

          <h2>Welcome Home, Yukki</h2>

          <p>
            We arrived home around 6 PM. The apartment felt different knowing we'd brought a new life into it. Yukki was still sleeping when we pulled into the parking space. We didn't want to wake him. He'd had a big day, leaving his mother, leaving his siblings, riding in a car, meeting his new home.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a few minutes of lying on the couch, he fell asleep again. We gently put him on his blanket. Yukki's bed hadn't arrived yet, so the blanket became his first bed. He had a very good sleep :)
          </p>

          <!-- Image 5: After "He had a very good sleep" -->

          <h2>To Anyone Considering a Shiba Inu</h2>

          <p>
            If you're thinking about getting a Shiba Inu, here's our advice:
          </p>

          <p>
            Please do your research. They're not like other dogs. They have unique needs and personalities. Find a responsible breeder; it matters more than you think. Be patient with the waiting process and with the training. Prepare to be challenged. Shiba Inus are stubborn. They'll test you.
          </p>

          <p>
            But also prepare to fall completely in love. Because once a Shiba Inu bonds with you, that bond is special.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our journey continues. This is just the beginning of our story with Yukki. There will be challenges ahead, training difficulties, behavioral issues, and vet visits.
          </p>

          <p>
            But there will also be so much joy. Adventures together. Quiet moments. Unconditional love.
          </p>

          <p>
            I can't wait to see who Yukki becomes as he grows up. And I'm grateful every day that we took this leap.
          </p>
